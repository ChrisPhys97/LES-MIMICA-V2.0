This data visualization is a part of three sensitivity tests conducted by MISU MIT Cloud and Aerosol (MIMICA) LES model for my BSc graduation thesis.
MIMICA is a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model using two approaches for Eddy diffusivities:

1. A first-order closure approach (Deardorff)

2. A zero-order approach (Smagorinsky & Lilly)

This project aimed to simulate the Marine Statocumulus Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) using case studies based on on-site data gatherd during the DYCOMS-II campaign off the coast of California (Akerman et all., 2009).

Simple matplotlib's features are used to give insights of the most beautiful microstructures of turbulance when ABL is shear-dominant.
